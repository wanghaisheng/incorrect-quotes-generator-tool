**A little overcomplicated web thing that inserts character names into prompts to make "incorrect quotes". Because comedy.**

 ~~Rips off~~ heavily inspired by [Scatterpatter's Incorrect Quotes Generator](https://incorrect-quotes-generator.neocities.org/) â€” in fact, all of the prompts are stolen from his generator.

Colors are from / based on Holllo's color theme, [Love](https://love.holllo.cc/). (It's quite pretty!) Love is under the [MIT License](https://git.holllo.cc/Holllo/love/src/branch/main/LICENSE).

The external link icon ("arrow-up-right-from-square") is from [Font Awesome 6.0](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons/arrow-up-right-from-square?s=solid). Its SVG code is in [style.sass](sass/style.sass).

# development
> making more stuff!

## contributing
[Issues](https://github.com/12beesinatrenchcoat/incorrect-quotes-generator/issues/new) and pull requests welcome (please create an issue if you plan on working on anything major though, thanks!)

## code
This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/12beesinatrenchcoat/incorrect-quotes-generator.git
cd incorrect-quotes-generator
npm i
```

For a development environment, `npm run dev` or `npx vite`.

To build, run `npm run build` or `npx vite build`.

To preview a build, run `npm run preview` or `npx vite preview`.

## prompt sets
The [rawPromptSets](./rawPromptSets) directory contains the sets of prompts, each of which are formatted like:
```jsonc
{
	"title": "a title for this fine collection of prompts",
	"description": "an equally fine description",
	"url": "creator's url or something. attribution.",
	// object containing arrays
	"prompts": {
		"1": [ // prompts grouped by how many characters are in them
			{ // text: String; tags: [String]
				"text": "{1}: boy do i like beans!",
				"tags": ["shipping", "swearing"] // optional.
			}
		]
	}
}
```
I'll make an editor for them later.

There's also [promptSetList.json](public/promptSetList.json), containing all the loadable prompt sets.

If you want to load your own prompt sets, use the `window.fetchPromptSet(path, key)` function (where "path" is a path to the json file, and "key" is what the set will be internally referred to)! \
Feel free to submit pull requests.
